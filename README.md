# `Vixcord`

---
## A modern remake of Discord built with simplicity in mind
---

# How the app it works?
 ### Vixcord uses a simple [`socket.io`](https://socket.io) plugin to send messages from the client to the server —— resolving conflict is handled server-side also.
 ### Markdown is supported via `shutdown`

 # Features
   * Markdown support
   * Full emoji support - `:smile:`, for instance.

   * Channels for the servers are allowed
